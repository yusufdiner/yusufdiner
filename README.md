### Hi there 👋

I am a 3rd-year computer science student at Hacettepe University. I've been actively involved in software for 3 years.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning web development
- ⚡ Fun fact: The first confirmed incident of a computer bug was reported at 3:45 PM on September 9, 1947 and I still don't understand how this bug got to my project 76 years later :D

Thanks for visiting.
