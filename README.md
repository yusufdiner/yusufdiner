### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

I am a 3rd-year computer science student at Hacettepe University. I've been actively involved in software for 3 years.

- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning web development
- - ğŸ”­ I'm still trying to learn machine learning
- âš¡ Fun fact: The first confirmed incident of a computer bug was reported at 3:45 PM on September 9, 1947 and I still don't understand how this bug got to my project 76 years later :D

Thanks for visiting.
